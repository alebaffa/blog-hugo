      <description>The Transformation Priority Premise (TPP) is a great empirical list of transformations that you can apply in your code when you’re working in TDD:
When do you need it? Practicing with TDD I realized that sometimes I reach a point when I get stuck: I am almost scared to add a new particular test because I already know it’s going to force me to completely rewrite the structure of the code.</description>

      <description>I was talking with a guy some days ago and it went like this:
 he told me &amp;ldquo;I really would like to start improving myself and I need a pet project..&amp;ldquo; I said &amp;ldquo;great idea! But where do you want to improve?&amp;ldquo; he said &amp;ldquo;..that&amp;rsquo;s the problem: I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what I want to use. There are so many things out there that I would like to learn &amp;hellip; and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;  This made me think about a book I read some time ago called &amp;ldquo;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less&amp;rdquo; (the author gave also an awesome TED Talk about it).</description>
