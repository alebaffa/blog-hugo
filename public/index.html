      I started my journey at Rakuten in June 2017 and, more precisely, I am Full Stack Engineer working for Rakuten Magazine. It&rsquo;s a pretty new Web project, so it&rsquo;s not big and we are very few people: 4 guys focused on Web and API (myself included), and 3 guys on Android/iOS.
First huge difference from my previous job: here I can put my hands on literally everything. We have a total freedom to choose what technology stack to use, if it&rsquo;s reasonable and well argumented.

      It&rsquo;s almost the end of the year and, as always, it&rsquo;s time to stop for a moment and look back. These first 6 months in Tokyo have been a mix of joy and struggle. I am finally living a kind of normal life with my wife and it&rsquo;s fantastic, of course. We are making up for lost time and we&rsquo;re having a lot of fun together. I lost the count of how many hours we spent at karaoke or how many times we ate sushi at our favorite place in Shinjuku.

      After 7 years spent in France I am officially moving to Tokyo, Japan, end of May 2017. I am finally going to join my wife, Sarah, after almost 5 years of long and hard distant relationship.
Now, before to start with the burocracy madness and to move/sell/close/sign things, I am sitting here at home, in the first weekend after having resigned from my current company, trying to think about how many things I learned over the last 7 years.

      About project I organized the local event of the Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 in Sophia Antipolis, Nice area, South of France. It&rsquo;s the biggest worldwide event for developers organized by the international Software Craftsmanship Community and it takes places every year in more than 100 cities in the world.
I organized the first one ever in South of France with a big success: 50 people participated.
I took care of finding the sponsors, the location and the communication on social media and with local companies.

      During SoCraTes France we had a session called Beyond Alchemy and What are the Software Leprechauns? with Laurent Bossavit, author of The Leprechauns of Software Engineering. We discussed about what we could do, as a community of professional developers, to raise the bar of our industry by starting to merge the scientific method used by academics and the huge amount of data from the real world of the industry.

      My second time in a Software Craftsmanship and Testing (SoCraTes) conference and, as always, it has been an awesome experience.
The self-made agenda SoCraTes is a non-conference, which means that there’s no predefined agenda, but instead it is created every day by the participants (the image above is the agenda of day 2). Everybody is more than welcome to propose sessions. They can be presentation of something you know, or open discussion about a topic you are curious about, or more simply a session where you want to learn something and you are looking for someone more experienced to help you.

      We did it! The Global Day of Coderetreat in Sophia Antipolis has been a great success! My first coderetreat ever, and I played the role of the organizer and facilitator. It’s an event that I started to organize in August and I have been lucky to find the support of the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis and my company, Amadeus IT Group. In the organization of all this I have been hugely helped by other people who have been facilitators with me (we were 3 facilitators, 1 host and 2 facilitators/helpers).

      The TextConverter exercise (in the Racing Car kata suite) is a very interesting exercise for refactoring legacy code. As I am reading Working Effectively with Legacy Code I found two ways of solving it.
Refactoring can only be done safely with unit tests and so I did, rigourously in TDD. Though, in this blog post I am not going to show you all the testing process, but only the two ways of decoupling the dependency.

      This is a question that came up yesterday during our latest meetup with our local French Riviera Software Craftsmanship Community (note: a very nice round table session on the beach of Juan Les Pins ). This post is my answer to this question.
What Software Craftsmanship is not It’s not an elitist club of people who think to hold the truth of how to write the perfect code. This is an important aspect because it is related to how much inclusive or exclusive a group of people is (and also to how much nice people are).
