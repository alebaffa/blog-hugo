      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I&amp;rsquo;m practicing with Go, but I had still never tried its concurrency features so far. My bad.
Fortunately exercism.io has just introduced me to this topic with the exercise &amp;ldquo;Parallel Letter Frequency&amp;rdquo; exercise&amp;rdquo;.
The core of my solution is here (I let you read the comments).
Basically the exercise asks you to count the frequency of the letters in 3 different strings. They provide you with already a function that counts the frequency, but you are asked to call that function with 3 calls in parallel (one call for each string) and to collect the result (the total frequencies from all the 3 strings).</description>

      <description>Today I’ve been at the dotGo conference in Paris, the European conference about the Go programming language. Quick summary: fantastic!
It’s the second time I participate (I’ve been there also last year, 2014) and I found exactly the same impeccable organization, a beautiful location (with lots of food..), a great ambiance, and the talks, as usual, have been extremely interesting, inspiring and cool. Some of them (not in the same order of the conference):</description>
