&lt;p&gt;This is a question that came up yesterday during our latest meetup with our local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/French-Riviera-Software-Craftsmanship-Community&#34;&gt;French Riviera Software Craftsmanship Community&lt;/a&gt; (note: a very nice round table session &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/French-Riviera-Software-Craftsmanship-Community/events/232721703/&#34;&gt;on the beach&lt;/a&gt; of Juan Les Pins ).
This post is my answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-software-craftsmanship-is-not&#34;&gt;What Software Craftsmanship is not&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not an elitist club&lt;/strong&gt; of people who think to hold the truth of how to write the perfect code. This is an important aspect because it is related to how much inclusive or exclusive a group of people is (and also to how much nice people are). I’ve been following the international Software Craftsmanship movement since some time now and I met some of them during &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/alebaffa-blog/a-community-of-professionals-socrates-uk-927fd0bb85f4&#34;&gt;SoCraTes UK&lt;/a&gt; and I learned how much important are things like kindness, mentorship and empathy for a Software Crafts(wo)man. Software development is not only techniques and programming: it’s also relationship and communication with your peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not a certification&lt;/strong&gt; of one’s capabilities to write good software (assuming it does exist really). A person yesterday was doubtful whether he could call himself a software craftsman or not because he is not working in TDD or applying all the time the SOLID principles.
These are technicalities, very important ones, but they are just tools that a person who cares about what he does can use or not in his daily job.
It’s not in conflict with the Agile movement. Software Craftsmanship is focused a lot more on technical practices and writing quality software, but the goal is always the same: deliver values for the customer. The only difference is that Software Craftsmanship is more focused on you as a person. For a Software Crafts(wo)man adding value for the customer passes through a constant personal improvement and a willing to help the team to improve as well.
Agile and Craftsmanship share the same focus on the importance of communication, collaboration, relationship and empathy. They are two sides of the same coin (unfortunately they are still being perceived as mutually-exclusive, while they’re not. But it’s changing1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-software-craftsmanship-is&#34;&gt;What Software Craftsmanship is&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a set of values that you embrace and you decide to follow for the rest of your life, not only your professional career. I remember when I first read the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501&#34;&gt;The Software Craftsman&lt;/a&gt;, by Sandro Mancuso, and I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OhXqBlCmrM&#34;&gt;one of his talks&lt;/a&gt;, and I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wow, that’s it! This is what I was looking for. This is the path I want to follow. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these values that make you a Software Crafts(wo)man? I will try to list what I think they are the most important for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-improvement&#34;&gt;Continuous improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not because a Software Crafts(wo)man is a geek and so he/she has the need to try the latest technologies. It’s rather because he/she wants to pragmatically find new ways to add value to what he/she does every day. And the only way is to improve our skills by practicing, reading books, meeting people, going to conferences etc. Improving means also to learn and to be open to technologies and techniques in order to evaluate them with rationality, pragmatism and no prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always make the link between continuous improvement and the second value of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best metaphor to describe continuous improvement is the journey towards mastery. A Software Crafts(wo)man is a journey man, he/she’s not the master who is arrived at destination (is there one, by the way?). The journey is something that everybody can take, regardless of how fast he/she can walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-of-professionalism&#34;&gt;The idea of Professionalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was illuminating to me to start to think of my employer as my client. This can sound so trivial for self-employed people, but it’s not so for those who have been hired by a company. Professionalism means that you always strive to be better because you want to add value to what you do and to constantly deliver quality, pragmatically. This includes continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mentorship-help-others-to-improve&#34;&gt;Mentorship: help others to improve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Software Crafts(wo)man not only improves himself, but also he love to help others to improve their skills, both technical and soft ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-aspects-of-software-development&#34;&gt;Social aspects of Software Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Software Crafts(wo)man cares about the team and his/her peers. The social aspects of software development are being maybe the most important ones during SoCraTes UK. How to motivate people, how to be inclusive and not exclusive at a personal level and at team level, how to help a team or a colleague to unleash its potential .. these are things that a Software Crafts(wo)man cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see I didn’t talk about technologies. I didn’t talk about Test-Driven Development neither Docker, nor the latest programming languages. Technologies and techniques are tools that a Software Crafts(wo)man needs to know and practice, but they are not the only things and it’s not important to be Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg to be a Software Crafts(wo)man. It’s not about how good you are, it’s all about values, willing to improve yourself and help others. It’s about taking your journey towards mastery and start to walk at your own speed.
If you believe and if you want to embrace the values I mentioned in this post, or if you are already following them, you are already a Software Crafts(wo)man. Or whatever other definition you like to use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Surrounding yourself with the right people</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../../../img/cerini.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;passion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 8 years old when I started playing guitar. It was not my choice, though, but my parents’ who forced me to start taking some lessons. I hated it at the beginning: hours of solfège, and I wasn’t even able to play the most stupid song. No chords, nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I had some natural talent for music (I’m gifted with the so called musical ear. And so my brother and sister are - the Force is strong in my family), and maybe my parents knew that and that’s why they persisted so much with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passed and I learned chords and arpeggios. I actually became so good until the point where my teacher told me that I was his most successful student ever, and he didn’t have anything more to teach me. He suggested me to go to the conservatory, but it was too much of an engagement both for me and for my parents and so I quite taking lessons.
I remember I felt relieved. No more lessons, no more waste of my precious time (1 hour / week &amp;hellip;). I could spend that hour playing football with my friends. So I quit playing guitar in general.
I was 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t touch my guitar for about 7 years, until a summer when I made a new friend. He was (he still is) an extraordinary guitarist, and he was able to reproduce all the songs he knew just listening to them for few minutes. He was always the coolest guy of the party. And he was/is also an extremely nice and funny guy. I loved the way he played his guitar, and his passion was so contagious that he made me willing to take mine and start playing again. During those few weeks my passion came back with all its strength. I started to learn new chords, find new ones and I soon realized that I was not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My passion was driving me to a new level of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt; and I found some things to be easier than I thought years before. &lt;strong&gt;My friend’s passion has triggered mine&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve been playing guitar no-stop for years since then, and I improved so much. I own two guitars now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love photography. I started to take photos when I first came here in south of France from Italy. The scenery was beautiful and so I thought to buy my first DSLR (a Nikon D70s). When I started using it I was very bad, I wasn’t even able to take a good photo in normal conditions and all those gears were difficult to manage. After some months with no improvements I gave up. I didn’t use my Nikon for about a year until I registered to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://kelbyone.com/&#34;&gt;online course&lt;/a&gt; where I discovered the post-processing. I was hooked. I discovered a new entire world of possibilities and so I started to improve my photos in order to apply all those cools things I was looking on the web. Then I tried &lt;a href=&#34;http://strobist.blogspot.fr/2011/01/introducing-strobist-lighting-in-layers.html&#34;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt;, and in one year I hugely improved my skills and now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/alebaffa/&#34;&gt;I’m not so bad&lt;/a&gt;. Again, something that has brought my passion back to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with passion and optimism is one of the best things you can do to improve yourself and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason why I started to go to conferences: once back home you’re so full of enthusiasm that you restart whatever you do with a new energy.
It’s the reason why I started to co-organize a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/French-Riviera-Software-Craftsmanship-Community/&#34;&gt;local Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s also the reason why I like being a developer advocate, because I meet and work with so many passionate people who trigger my passion and pro-activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being surrounded by passionate people can speed up your learning process by giving you that amount of motivation that you sometime may lose on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
