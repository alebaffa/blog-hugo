      The Transformation Priority Premise (TPP) is a great empirical list of transformations that you can apply in your code when you’re working in TDD:
When do you need it? Practicing with TDD I realized that sometimes I reach a point when I get stuck: I am almost scared to add a new particular test because I already know it’s going to force me to completely rewrite the structure of the code.

      A couple of weeks ago I participated for the first time to a SoCraTes event, one of the Software Craftsmanship international gatherings. SoCraTes (Software Craftsmanship and Testing) is an self-organized conference where the people from the international Software Craftsmanship Community meet and spend 3 days organizing themselves activities and talks around everything related to software craftsmanship: from the technical to the human aspects of it. There are few events of this kind every year (Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Romania, Finland, Canaries) and I participated to the one in UK.

  <p>
    
      It&rsquo;s been a while I&rsquo;m practicing with Go, but I had still never tried its concurrency features so far. My bad.
Fortunately exercism.io has just introduced me to this topic with the exercise &ldquo;Parallel Letter Frequency&rdquo; exercise&rdquo;.
The core of my solution is here (I let you read the comments).
Basically the exercise asks you to count the frequency of the letters in 3 different strings. They provide you with already a function that counts the frequency, but you are asked to call that function with 3 calls in parallel (one call for each string) and to collect the result (the total frequencies from all the 3 strings).

      I was talking with a guy some days ago and it went like this:
 he told me &ldquo;I really would like to start improving myself and I need a pet project..&ldquo; I said &ldquo;great idea! But where do you want to improve?&ldquo; he said &ldquo;..that&rsquo;s the problem: I still don&rsquo;t know what I want to use. There are so many things out there that I would like to learn &hellip; and I don&rsquo;t know where to start&hellip;&ldquo;  This made me think about a book I read some time ago called &ldquo;The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less&rdquo; (the author gave also an awesome TED Talk about it).

  <p>
    
      Slices are a great tool in Go, but sometimes they can be confused with arrays. A small reminder: slices are a pointer into an underline array. Let&rsquo;s take this example:
array := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} slice := array[1:3] // let's print both fmt.Println(&quot;array: &quot;, array) fmt.Println(&quot;slice: &quot;, slice) // array: [1 2 3 4 5 6] // slice: [2 3]  Since the slice is only a pointer to the underline array, if you do some operations with the elements of the array you are also changing the elements of the slice.

      I was 8 years old when I started playing guitar. It was not my choice, though, but my parents’ who forced me to start taking some lessons. I hated it at the beginning: hours of solfège, and I wasn’t even able to play the most stupid song. No chords, nothing at all.
Nevertheless I had some natural talent for music (I’m gifted with the so called musical ear. And so my brother and sister are - the Force is strong in my family), and maybe my parents knew that and that’s why they persisted so much with me.

      so, you want to finally release your preciousss written in Go to the open source community. Great! And thank you. Though, there are few things you may want to consider before doing the big step. Things that you may have missed perhaps because you are not yet 100% comfortable with Go (but “_I will improve later. Now let me just put this gem on Github._”). You have to know that the Go community can be quite strict when it comes to its idioms and conventions.

      Today I’ve been at the dotGo conference in Paris, the European conference about the Go programming language. Quick summary: fantastic!
It’s the second time I participate (I’ve been there also last year, 2014) and I found exactly the same impeccable organization, a beautiful location (with lots of food..), a great ambiance, and the talks, as usual, have been extremely interesting, inspiring and cool. Some of them (not in the same order of the conference):
