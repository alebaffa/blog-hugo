      <description>I am a Software Engineer based in Tokyo and I currently make things work at Rakuten where I am a Web engineer. More on LinkedIn.
I like working in projects where I can handle the full technical stack, from the frontend to the backend. I like doing stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried before and I consider every difficulty an occasion to learn and improve my myself. I also love to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with the community by organizing meetups, workshops, learning events or giving presentations.</description>
