I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Tokyo and I currently make things work at Rakuten. More on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrobaffa).


My greatest passion is to make people and teams more productive and efficient. 
I love to create and foster a learning culture in the companies I work for, and I always organize learning activities to help knowledge spread and people improve. I have experience in organizing _coding dojos_, facilitating _open spaces_ and organize small conferences.
Simply put: I love to help people improve their skills.


Oh, in my spare time I'm kind of a big geek. I'm currently improving my skills in Deep Learning, Data Science and Blockchain. I am a hysterical _Star Wars_ fan (even though _The Force Awakens_.......). I loved only the first season of _Mr Robot_. I loved _Heroes_, but I was happy when they shut it down too.


I am happily married with a bright-lovely-genius Humanoid-Roboticist, [@gaijingeek](https://twitter.com/gaijingeek). 


I am studying Japanese, which is going to be my 4th language after Italian (mother tongue), English (fluent) and French (fluent). 


I love photography. I was kind of a semi-professional wedding photographer for a few years in South France, where I also enjoyed landscape photography. My photos are on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alebaffa/) and [500px](https://500px.com/alebaffa).


I use heavily [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alebaffa) and it's the best way to get in contact with me immediately.
