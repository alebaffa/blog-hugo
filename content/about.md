I am a Full Stack Engineer living in Tokyo. More on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrobaffa).

I am a geek. I love all kind of technology and learn new stuff every day. I am currently particularly interested in Machine/Deep Learning, Data Science, IoT and DevOps.

I am also a photography enthusiast. I like wedding and landscape photography. I post my photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alebaffa/). 

I use heavily [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alebaffa).

This blog contains my personal thoughts and opinions about things that I learn.
