*Happy New Year!* Feels so weird to listen after what we just went through.  Here in Tokyo we are on the verge of the second state of emergency (i.e. kind of soft lockdown, not formally as strict as in EU, but culturally hard enough to refrain people from gathering and spread the infection all over the city. At least, this worked in 2020.). We are starting to see some light at the end of this tunnel, but there is still a lot of darkness.

## So, what to wish for this 2021? 

I wish everybody to be able to reframe their priorities following what 2020 has abruptly reminded us:

- be flexible and skilled enough to be ready for sudden changes and adjustments, both personally and professionally;
- be rational, calm, open minded and welcoming to any challenge, both physical and intellectual. Learn what is the scientific method and use it;
- prioritize quality over quantity;
- appreciate what you have and strive to give back what/when/how you can;
- learn to put yourself in other people's shoes and thank for everything you receive;
- it's never too late to express your love, friendship and respect to family, friends and colleagues. Wait and it could be too late.

**Happy New Year!**
