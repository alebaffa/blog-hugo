I am a Software Engineer based in Tokyo and I currently make things work at Rakuten where I am a Web engineer. More on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrobaffa).

I like working in projects where I can handle the full technical stack, from the frontend to the backend. I like doing stuff I've never tried before and I consider every difficulty an occasion to learn and improve my myself. I also love to share what I've learned with the community by organizing meetups, workshops, learning events or giving presentations.

In my spare time I'm learning Machine/Deep Learning and Blockchain.

I am also studying Japanese, my 4th language after Italian, English and French. 

I am a photography enthusiast. I like wedding and landscape photography. 
I post my photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alebaffa/). 

I use heavily [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alebaffa).

This blog contains my personal thoughts and opinions about things I learn.
