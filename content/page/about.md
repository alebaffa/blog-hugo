<img src="../../img/me.jpg" alt="alebaffa" style="width: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 20px"/> Hi, my name is **Alessandro Baffa**, I am an Italian Software Engineer and Developer Advocate currently working at [Amadeus IT Group](http://www.amadeus.com), in South France. More info on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrobaffa).

I am a strong advocate of clean code and doing always the best you can. I am also firmly convinced that a good professional should never stop learning, and so I do.

I love helping people. I love organizing activities and creating stuff that is useful for the community.
I am also learning how to motivate people and how to drive changes, and I'm loving it.

This blog contains my personal thoughts about what I'm learning.
