<img src="../../img/me.jpg" alt="alebaffa" style="width: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 20px"/> Hi, my name is **Alessandro Baffa**, I am an Italian Software Engineer and Developer Advocate at [Amadeus IT Group](http://www.amadeus.com). More info on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrobaffa).

I am very interested in software engineering, with a particular focus on OOP, testing and web programming.

I am a strong advocate of clean code and good practices, and I am firmly convinced that a good professional should never stop learning.

This blog contains what I am finding on my personal journey towards software craftsmanship.
