Hello, this is Alessandro Baffa. I am a Software Engineer and Solution Architect based in Tokyo, Japan.
I've always been interested to the Web, its technologies, protocols, architectures and its implications on business and society. I spent more than 10 years as a Java backend programmer and I now follow customers on projects related to Internet of Things (IoT).
