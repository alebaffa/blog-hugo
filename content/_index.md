Hello, this is Alessandro Baffa. I am a Software Engineer and Solution Architect based in Tokyo.
I've always been interested to the Web, its technologies, protocols, architectures and its implications on business and society. 

Currently I help customers and developers in Japan to adopt and operate [Corda blockchain](https://www.corda.net/).  

Ah, for the record, this blog is currently hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), the Inter-Planetary File System (CID: [QmZJ82NoQT7GHZoRqLpwiBLhpLUYnYoNP1muGSJ9nU8QDc](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZJ82NoQT7GHZoRqLpwiBLhpLUYnYoNP1muGSJ9nU8QDc)).

よろしくお願いいたします。
