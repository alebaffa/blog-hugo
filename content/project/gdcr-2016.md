## About project

I organized the local event of the Global Day of Coderetreat 2016 in Sophia Antipolis, Nice area, South of France. It's the biggest worldwide event for developers organized by the international Software Craftsmanship Community and it takes places every year in more than 100 cities in the world.

I organized the first one ever in South of France with a big success: 50 people participated.

I took care of finding the sponsors, the location and the communication on social media and with local companies.
