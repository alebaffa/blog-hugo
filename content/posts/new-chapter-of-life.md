After 7 years spent in France I am officially moving to Tokyo, Japan, end of May 2017. 
I am finally going to join my wife, Sarah, after almost 5 years of long and hard distant relationship.

Now, before to start with the burocracy madness and to move/sell/close/sign things, I am sitting here at home, in the first weekend after having resigned from my current company, trying to think about how many things I learned over the last 7 years. How many things I'm going to bring with me from this French experience.

It's strange to say, but the first thing that comes to my mind is my current employer, **Amadeus**. I would have never thought that a company could have been so important for my life. Despite its difficulties and things that, sometimes, I may not like of it, at the end of the day I am leaving a really great place that completely changed me and made me a better person and professional (I even found my wife :D). I grew and learned so much here. I will always be thankful to this company and to my fantastic colleagues I've been honored to work with.

I am also thinking about all the things that I started to do here in France. Photography has become my passion and I'm so thrilled to think that I'm going to live in the city of Nikon and Fujifilm :) I have so many ideas about photography in Japan!
I also started to organize events and I started to overcome my fear of public speaking. I can't wait to start to be an active member in the technical Meetups panorama of Tokyo, and also to organize one (Tokyo Software Craftsmanship? :-)). I started to travel and to know people from all around the world. I learned well French and improved my English. I started to have a fully multicultural life. I changed my point of view on everything and I learned that everything is relative: _tout est relatif_. I started to be a Global Citizen. I learned what I want to do and I have a clear direction for my future career.

I could write for hours just listing all the things I learned, but I stop here.

I am leaving with a bag of experience, a huge amount of energy and lots of ideas for the future. But most important, I can't wait to start living with my wife, have a _normal life_ with her - if we can say _normal_ in Tokyo - settle down and raise a family together for the first time.

I'm thrilled. I can't wait. 

_Merci la France_ for everything you gave me.
