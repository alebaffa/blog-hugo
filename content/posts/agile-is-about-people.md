I am reading Uncle Bob's _Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices_, a book that was in my TODO list since too long, and the first section is about Agile Practices where he describes the Agile principles. This very first section made me connect other things that I recently read and watched about "Scaling Agile".

Here some parts from the first section of the book.

> **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.** [...] Remember, building the team is more important than building the environment. Many teams and managers make the mistake of building the environment first and expecting the team to gel automatically. Instead, work to create the team, and then let the team configure the environment on the basis of need.

>> **Working software over comprehensive documentation.** [...]We transfer our knowledge to them [new team members] by sitting next to them and helping them. We make them part of the team through close training and interaction.[...]

>> **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** [...] The best contracts are those that govern the way the development team and the customer will work together.[...]

>> **Responding to change over following a plan.**
